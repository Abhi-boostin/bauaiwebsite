## ✅ Strengths

1. **🏆 BEST design of all competitors** — Modern SaaS 2.0, clean, premium feel
2. **Named AI personas** — "Atlas AI" and "Bob AI" make abstract AI tangible and friendly
3. **Blue aura/glow effect** — Unique design element that creates visual distinction
4. **News in navigation** — Clever use of funding announcement as social proof
5. **"Risk-free"** CTA copy — Reduces conversion anxiety

## ❌ Weaknesses

1. **Very new** — Limited customer base means limited social proof
2. **No video demo** — For a product about "agents," seeing them work is crucial
3. **Somewhat long page** — Could benefit from progressive disclosure
4. **US-focused language** — No localization for international markets
5. **No pricing page visible** — Creates uncertainty about cost
6. **Named agents may confuse** — Some users might not understand the "AI coworker" metaphor

## 🎯 What to Steal / Avoid

| ✅ Steal | ❌ Avoid |
|---------|---------|
| 🔥 Blue aura/glow effect around content | Being too US-centric |
| Named AI agent personas with icons | Overcomplicating the "agent" metaphor |
| Funding news in navigation bar | No video demo for agent-based product |
| "Risk-free" CTA copy | Long single-page approach |
| ROI metrics with specific numbers | Limited localization |
| Phase-based feature matrix | Early-stage limited social proof |
| Variable font for premium typography | |
