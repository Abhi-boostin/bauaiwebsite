3. **No pricing information** — Common in early-stage but creates friction
4. **Feature bubbles can be overwhelming** — Too many floating elements can distract
5. **Blog content is sparse** — Limited thought leadership to support SEO
6. **Mobile optimization concerns** — Complex 3D graphics may not translate well

## 🎯 What to Steal / Avoid

| ✅ Steal | ❌ Avoid |
|---------|---------|
| Dark theme with glow effects | Being visually empty of product detail |
| 3D hero graphic concept | Showing tech partner logos as customer logos |
| Floating feature bubbles approach | Over-relying on visual effects over substance |
| "Legacy vs Modern" positioning | Webflow template feel |
| Embedded video demo | Sparse blog/content strategy |
