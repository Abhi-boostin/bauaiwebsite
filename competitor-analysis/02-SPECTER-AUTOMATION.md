## ✅ Strengths

1. **Bold, minimalist design** — Immediately feels premium and tech-forward
2. **Unique brand mascot** — The ghost icon creates memorable brand identity
3. **Voice-first messaging** — Clear differentiation from text-input competitors
4. **Generous whitespace** — Content is easy to scan and digest
5. **Multi-language support** — EN/DE switch readily available

## ❌ Weaknesses

1. **Lack of social proof** — No customer logos, testimonials, or usage statistics
2. **No video demo** — For a voice-controlled product, not hearing it in action is a missed opportunity
3. **Limited product screenshots** — Only one laptop mockup; doesn't show the full product depth
4. **Weak CTAs** — "Book a Demo" is subtle; no urgency or benefit-driven CTA copy
5. **No pricing transparency** — No mention of packages or a pricing page
6. **Contact form requires reCAPTCHA** — Adds friction to the conversion flow

## 🎯 What to Steal / Avoid

| ✅ Steal | ❌ Avoid |
|---------|---------|
| Massive, bold typography for headlines | Text-only hero (needs visual impact) |
| Ghost/mascot brand element | Missing social proof entirely |
| Generous whitespace philosophy | Lack of product depth/screenshots |
| Pill-shaped buttons (trendy) | Hiding main navigation behind a button |
